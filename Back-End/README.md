<!-- # Backend Assessment for Product Application

## Setting up the Backend

1. **Fork Repository**: Begin by forking the backend repository to your local machine.
2. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch with the name `firstname-lastname` to work on your project.
3. **Node.js Project**: Set up a new Node.js project for the backend.
4. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies.
5. **Create database**: Create a new database for the project using MongoDB Atlas.

## Instructions

Develop the backend for the E-commerce application to handle product creation, product retrieval, product updating, and product deletion.
